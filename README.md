# ZFNsearch
ZFNsearch is a Unix script for searching specific genomic sequence pairs, interrupted by random nucleic acids. It works with nucleotide FASTA sequences or whole genomes prepared using the included script Prapare_Genome.sh. The results include flanking sequences around the detected pattern (x100 bp on each side) for further analysis.
